"I have never been too comfortable with the past, the passage of time, or even the concept of it."

"I do not enjoy remembering lessons or enjoy reliving my happiest memories. It is there but it is gone, and it will never come back again- but it is right there cutting, searing through your veins." 

'The A sound:'

'My headphones wont drown it , they are the noise 
Banging against  my   brain 
End less ly
Everything is wrong,
(Everything you do is wrong)'

'I swear I never sold my soul, then why cant I get out?'

'I want my heart,
To want it,

As bad as  I do'

'I am surrounded by plants,
I am, by definition, part of an ecosystem'

'Whatever'

'There is a woman, a woman I love above myself and religion,
If only I did not fear god or her well-being,
I could love her above it too.'

'We are everything,
Us,
We are nothing'
